# Sozdik.kz API Wrapper

An API wrapper for the official Sozdik.kz API.

## Work
`getTranslation` method takes two arguments: `query` (your text that will be translated), `from` (language you desire to be used as a source one) and `to` (language you desire to be used as a target one).

-----------------

Available languages: Russian and Kazakh. (Ru & Kz)
Must know: it doesn't translate entire sentences, it just looks for examples of a word's usage in target language.
